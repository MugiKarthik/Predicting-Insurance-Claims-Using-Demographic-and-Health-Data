# Predicting-Insurance-Claims-Using-Demographic-and-Health-Data
Machine learning Project 
This dataset contains insightful information related to insurance 
claims, giving us an in-depth look into the demographic patterns of 
those receiving them. The dataset contains information on 
policyholder’s age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), steps 
(average steps walked by a person), medical costs charges, number 
of children, smoking status and region. By analyzing these key 
factors across geographical areas and across different 
demographics such as age or gender we can gain a greater 
understanding of who is most likely to receive an insurance claim. 
 This understanding gives us valuable insight that can be used to 
inform our decision making when considering potential customers 
for our services. On a broader scale it can inform public policy by 
allowing for more targeted support for those who are most in need 
and vulnerable. 
 These kinds of insights are extremely valuable and this dataset 
provides us with the tools we need to uncover them.

Dataset
The process of gathering and analyzing accurate data from various 
sources to find answers to research problems, trends and 
probabilities, etc., to evaluate possible outcomes is Known as Data 
Collection. It includes understanding the data to study the hidden 
patterns and trends which helps to predict and evaluate the results. 
The methods of data collection can vary depending on the type of 
data being collected and the purpose for which it is being collected. 
Here are some common methods of data collection: Surveys, 
Interviews, Observations, Experiments, Secondary data analysis, 
Case studies, etc.
The methods I used for this data collection is Secondary data 
analysis that means it involves analyzing data that has already been 
collected by others for a different purpose. This method can be used 
to answer research questions that cannot be answered with new 
data collection.
The data collected is originally from a person named Sumit 
Kumar Shukla and the dataset is an insurance dataset available in 
Kaggle. It several individual's health status, lifestyle habits, and 
financial situation analyst variables and one binary target variable.
The objective of this dataset is to predict whether an individual will 
make an insurance claim or not, based on their demographic and 
lifestyle characteristics. The dataset consist of several independent 
variables and one dependent variable, i.e., the outcome. 
Independent variables include policyholder’s age, gender, BMI 
(Body Mass Index), steps (average steps walked by a person), 
medical charges bills, number of children, smoking status and 
region.

 The insurance dataset consists of 1338 observation data 
points, with 9 features each.
 “insuranceclaim” is the feature we are going to predict, value 
inside this feature are 0 and 1 that means “not claim” and 
“claim” respectively.
 There is no null values in the dataset.
 The dataset format is stored in CSV format.
Variables description and understanding:
Serial No. Variables Description 
1 Age - Age of the policyholder
2 Sex - Gender of the policyholder
(female=0, male=1)
3 BMI - Body Mass Index, providing an 
understanding of the body, weights 
that are relatively high or low relative 
to height, objective index of body 
weight (kg/m^2) using the ratio of 
height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 25
4 Steps Average walking steps per day of the 
policyholder
5 Children Number of children/dependents of the 
policyholder
6 Smoker Smoking state of policyholder 
(non-smoke=0, smoker=1)
7 Region The residential area of the 
policyholder in the US 
(northeast 0, northwest=1, southeast2, southwest-3)
8 Charges Individual medical costs billed by 
health insurance.
9 Insurance 
claim
Number of insurance claimed or not
(not claimed =0, claimed=1)
